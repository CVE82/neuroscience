## Neuroscience Major

A **major in Neuroscience** enables students to pursue a curriculum in several departments, colleges, and schools at Temple University in one of the most dynamic areas of science. Neuroscience is an interdisciplinary field addressing neural and brain function at multiple levels. It encompasses a broad domain that ranges from molecular genetics and neural development, to brain processes involved in cognition and emotion, to mechanisms and consequences of neurodegenerative disease. The field of neuroscience also includes mathematical and physical principles involved in modeling neural systems and in brain imaging.

A number of departments throughout Temple University include research and teaching in neuroscience, including departments in the Colleges of Engineering (CE), Health Professions (CHP), Liberal Arts (CLA), Science and Technology (CST), and the School of Medicine (TUSM). Neuroscience courses are open to students with any major at Temple University.
