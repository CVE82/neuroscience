## Neuroscience Major

A **major in Neuroscience** enables students to pursue a curriculum in several departments, colleges, and schools at Temple University in one of the most dynamic areas of science. Neuroscience is an interdisciplinary field addressing neural and brain function at multiple levels. It encompasses a broad domain that ranges from molecular genetics and neural development, to brain processes involved in cognition and emotion, to mechanisms and consequences of neurodegenerative disease. The field of neuroscience also includes mathematical and physical principles involved in modeling neural systems and in brain imaging.

A number of departments throughout Temple University include research and teaching in neuroscience, including departments in the Colleges of Engineering (CE), Health Professions (CHP), Liberal Arts (CLA), Science and Technology (CST), and the School of Medicine (TUSM). Neuroscience courses are open to students with any major at Temple University.

## Courses

The Bachelor of Science degree in Neuroscience:  Systems, Behavior and Plasticity includes 52-54 required credits:

### Major Requirements:
Include table

## Neuroscience Minor

The Minor in Neuroscience Research expands opportunities for Temple students to get research experience and to become more competitive in their applications to graduate and professional schools. The required courses in the Neuroscience Research Minor focus on basic neuroscience, cellular and molecular neuroscience, and neuroscientific techniques. Because of some overlap in coursework, the students must choose to minor in either the Neuroscience Research or the Cognitive Neuroscience minor.

## Independent Study in Neuroscience

Students majoring in Neuroscience are strongly encouraged to participate in research by taking courses in Independent Study as part of their elective credits for the major. Independent study opportunities will be offered in many of the laboratories of the more than 130 neuroscience faculty members in the various participating colleges and schools. The [Student Services Coordinator](http://www.cla.temple.edu/neuroscience/contact/) and [Program Director](http://www.cla.temple.edu/neuroscience/contact/) will work with students to identify these independent study opportunities.

## Graduating with Distinction in Neuroscience

Majors in Neuroscience: Systems, Behavior, Plasticity have the opportunity to be awarded departmental distinction upon graduation. Graduation with Distinction can be achieved by maintaining a Grade Point Average 3.0 of better in all Neuroscience (NSI) Courses, completing two semesters of Independent Study in Neuroscience (NSI 4182 & 4282) with an A- or better, and successfully completing a neuroscience research project based on the independent study work and described in a research paper and poster presented to Neuroscience Program faculty and students.  Students MUST complete an Application for Distinction. Guidelines for the paper and poster can be found [here](http://www.cla.temple.edu/neuroscience/undergraduate/distinction-guidelines/).

## Careers

The undergraduate, interdisciplinary Neuroscience Major culminates in a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in Neuroscience:  Systems, Behavior and Plasticity. This major is appropriate for students aiming for professional careers in the health sciences. Students interested in graduate school in biology, chemistry, neuroscience, or psychology are also likely to find this program attractive.
