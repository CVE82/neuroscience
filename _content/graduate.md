## M.S. in Neuroscience: Systems, Behavior and Plasticity

### Program Overview

The M.S. in Neuroscience: Systems, Behavior and Plasticity provides highly advanced training and faculty-mentored research in a rapidly evolving field with practical applications in careers ranging from health
care to public policy and economics.

This innovative program was developed by Temple University’s Neuroscience faculty, consisting of top faculty from the Departments of Psychology, Physical Therapy, and Kinesiology, to help qualified students gain core expertise in specific areas of neuroscience — including molecular, cellular, systems and behavioral neuroscience.

In addition, our world-renowned faculty are committed to helping students develop professional competence in oral and written communication, as well as the analytical thinking and logic necessary to succeed in the
laboratory, the classroom and beyond.

### Programs of Study

There are 3 areas of study in the Neuroscience Master’s Program. They are:

- Cognitive Neuroscience
- Behavioral Neuroscience
- Motor Neuroscience and Rehabilitation

For more information on our affiliated faculty’s research in these three areas, please visit our [faculty page](http://www.cla.temple.edu/neuroscience/faculty-2/).

### Program requirements

NSCI 5002                  Neurochemistry  3 cr.

NSCI 9381                  Readings in Neuroscience   3 cr.

Electives1                    6 cr.

NSCI 9991 or 9995    Master’s Project  6 cr.

Total Credit Hours:          30

Students can take any elective relevant to their area of interest or specialization after approval from the program mentor.

### Master's Project:

Students are required to work on a Master’s project for both semesters in the second year. Depending upon their career goals, students may opt to get engaged either in a laboratory-based research project or in a non-laboratory project.  Those students who are motivated to join doctoral programs or are interested in research positions will likely gain by working independently on a neuroscientific investigation under the supervision of a faculty member that maintains an active neuroscience research program. The purpose of the project will be to not only train students in specific neuroscientific techniques but also to train students to develop scientific and analytical approach towards a problem, formulate clear research questions, conduct experiment, and analyze/interpret data.  On the other hand, students who are not intending bench-level research upon graduation and are  interested in non-research jobs (such as teaching, counseling, research administration, public policy etc.), may get engaged in a non-laboratory project of a similar scope. This may include activities such as conducting a literature review on a topic and presenting it to the audience, drafting a scope of work for a grant funding agency, preparing a consulting proposal for a prospective client.

### Careers

Because the brain is involved in every important human endeavor, understanding of brain and its functions opens career paths in multiple fields including medicine, psychology, law, engineering, education, and public policy.  Master’s-level education in neuroscience will provide students with a wide range of career options including teacher/lecturer, research and teaching administrator, research associate at academic research institutes or private industries, biostatistician, medical or science writer, clinical data manager, public health administrator, environmental health safety officer, counselor, regulatory affairs specialist, and public policy strategist.
