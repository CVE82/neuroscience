## Specialization Overview

In 1998 at Temple University, a university-wide interdisciplinary Program in Neuroscience was approved and funded by the Provostâ€™s Office to facilitate multidisciplinary interactions among faculty interested in neuroscience and to provide a Specialization in Neuroscience both at the graduate and undergraduate levels. The graduate program continues to be active. A Neuroscience Seminar Series includes Temple University faculty alternating as presenters with neuroscience faculty members invited from other universities. To facilitate university-wide participation, lectures alternate between the main and health sciences campuses. Students read recent articles by each speaker and meet with the speaker for journal-club style discussions. This gives students the opportunity to meet neuroscientists at Temple and from throughout the country. The Neuroscience Specialization will be awarded to students in the following departments: Biology, Pharmacology, Physical Therapy, and Psychology.
