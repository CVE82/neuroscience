**What are the benefits of membership?**

The first and foremost benefit of Nu Rho Psi membership is the honor and recognition of academic excellence. Almost all graduate schools and employers ask for a list of honors. Membership in Nu Rho Psi is a way of building these credentials. Members receive membership certificates and lapel pins as an indications of the honor. Beyond this, Nu Rho Psi membership is a springboard for the networking of like-minded colleagues interested in the study of the brain. As the Society transitions to a regional structure over the next few years, there will be regional and national meetings where neuroscientists form around the country will gather to share scientific findings. News and information will be available to members via the Nu Rho Psi online newsletter.
