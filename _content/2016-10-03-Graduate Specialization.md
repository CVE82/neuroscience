Any graduate student in a Ph.D. program at Temple University can participate in the Neuroscience Program.  A Graduate Specialization in Neuroscience is awarded upon completion of the Ph.D. and is listed on the student’s transcript. The following are the requirements to complete the Graduate Specialization in Neuroscience:

## Admission

For an application to the program, please contact the [Student Services Coordinator](tuf39500@temple.edu).

Graduate students are admitted to the Program after they have been accepted into a Ph.D. program based on an interest to pursue their research in the neuroscience area. Upon successful completion of their departmental and Neuroscience Program requirements, students receive a Ph.D. degree in the discipline represented by their department with a Specialization in Neuroscience. To fulfill the requirements of the Program, students must **pass courses in 2 areas of neuroscience as well as participate in the Neuroscience Program's Seminars and Journal Clubs for four semesters.**

## Requirements

_Requirements reflect changes made to Specialization in Fall 2014._

To be a graduate student in the Neuroscience Program, a student must fulfill the following requirements:

- Be a graduate student in good standing in a Temple University Ph.D. program.
- Meet all the obligations of the student's participating department.
- Have one member of the Neuroscience Program on their dissertation committee.
- Attend and participate at the Journal Club and seminars of the Neuroscience Program for 4 semesters.
- Take two course in each of the Neuroscience Specialization Areas:
**Behavioral /Cognitive / Systems Neuroscience
Cellular/Molecular Neuroscience**
